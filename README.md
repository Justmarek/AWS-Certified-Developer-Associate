# AWS Certified Developer Associate
I have been using AWS for a number of years now and decided it was time to get AWS certified. I decided to start with the AWS Certified Developer - Associate qualification, this repository contains my code snippets and ntoes which I used while preparing for this certification. While the qualification itself doesn't require you to know code or use the AWS CLI extensively, I found the code in this repo useful while preparing for the qualifaction.
